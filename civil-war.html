        <p>1960 &ndash; 1991</p>

<h4>There were many factors that contributed to the civil war in Somalia. Some of the most important factors include:</h4>
<ul>
    <li>The collapse of the Somali state in 1991: The Somali state collapsed in 1991, leaving a power vacuum that was filled by rival clans and militias. 
    This led to widespread violence and instability.</li>
    <li>Colonial legacy: Somalia was divided into five different regions by colonial powers in the late 19th century. 
    This division created artificial borders that have been a source of conflict ever since.</li>
    <li>Military repression: In 1969, a military coup overthrew the civilian government of Somalia. The military regime, led by General Mohamed Siad Barre, ruled Somalia for over two decades. 
    The Barre regime was repressive and authoritarian. It cracked down on dissent and human rights abuses were widespread.</li>
    <li>The clan system: Somalia has a complex clan system that has played a role in the civil war. 
    The clan system has divided the country and made it difficult to form a unified government.</li>
    <li>The drought and famine of 2011: The drought and famine of 2011 exacerbated the conflict in Somalia. 
    The drought led to widespread displacement and poverty, which made people more vulnerable to recruitment by armed groups.</li>
    <li>The involvement of Africa foreign powers: such as Ethiopia and Kenya, have intervened in Somalia on a number of occasions. 
    This has often made the situation worse, as it has led to further conflict and division.</li>
